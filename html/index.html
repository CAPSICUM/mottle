		TouchAdapter provides a means of capturing touch events and presenting them as mouse events, allowing you to perform common tasks without having to register two different types of events.  The script can operate directly on the DOM, or you can use one of the library versions of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			An additional feature of TouchAdapter is the ability to optionally suppress click events that occurred on
			some element after a mousedown/mouseup combination between which there were mousemove events. All browsers fire a click event if a mouseup occurs on some element on which a mousedown previously occurred, whether or not the mouse was moved in between.  In many contexts, particularly those related to applications for which jsPlumb is used, this doesn't make sense.
